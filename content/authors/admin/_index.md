Clifford “Chip” Heil is a Democratic candidate for Town Council. Chip promises to act as a steward of Hopkinton by respecting our Plans and Ordinances and our rural character. As Chip's friends, we know he'll be a true representative of our voices and will consider us in every decision he makes. Will you join us in supporting Chip?

**IMPORTANT ISSUES**:
**Town Plans and Ordinances** – Ensure that Plans and Ordinances are consistent and clear of conflicts and that they are strictly followed.

**Town and CHARIHO Budget** – Rigorously review budget line items and ensure responsible spending that maximizes our children’s education while minimizing the financial obligations of Hopkinton and its residents.

**Town Commissions and Boards** – Actively engage and encourage residents to participate on boards and commissions. Of particular importance is the reactivation of the Economic Development Commission to help create a responsible economic development plan to offset the tax rate.
